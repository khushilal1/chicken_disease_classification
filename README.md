# Chicken Disease Classification
## Overview
The Chicken Disease Classification project aims to build a machine learning model to classify diseases in chickens based on relevant features. This readme outlines the workflows and steps needed to update and maintain the project.

## Workflows
1. Update config.yaml
Edit the config.yaml file to configure model hyperparameters, file paths, and other settings. Ensure that this file is a centralized location for all configuration parameters.

2. Update secrets.yaml
If your project involves sensitive information, update the secrets.yaml file to include any necessary credentials or API keys.

3. Update params.yaml
Adjust the params.yaml file to set parameters related to the machine learning model or other components in the project. Keep this file organized and well-documented.

4. Update Utility Functions
Make changes to the utility functions in the utility directory. These functions may include data preprocessing, feature engineering, or any other tasks that support the main components of the project.

5. Update Configuration Manager in src/config
Update the configuration manager in the src/config directory to ensure seamless access to configuration parameters throughout the project components.

6. Update Components
Modify the components in the src/components directory. Update the data loader, model architecture, evaluation metrics, and any other components based on the project's evolving requirements.

7. Update the Pipeline
Modify the pipeline in the src/pipeline directory to incorporate changes in the components. Ensure that the workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation remains well-defined.

8. Update main.py
Update the main.py script to orchestrate the overall workflow. This file serves as the entry point for running the project, pulling everything together.

9. Update dvc.yaml
Modify the dvc.yaml file to reflect changes in the data versioning and management configuration. Ensure that the Data Version Control (DVC) settings align with the evolving project structure.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Implement robust data preprocessing functions to clean and format the input data for the model.

Feature Engineering: Enhance the model's performance by incorporating relevant feature engineering techniques.

Model Training: Train the machine learning model using the configured parameters and the prepared dataset.

Evaluation Metrics: Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance and adjust as needed.

Data Versioning: Employ Data Version Control (DVC) to track changes in data and ensure reproducibility.
